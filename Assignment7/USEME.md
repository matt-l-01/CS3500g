##How to use the GUI
- In order to use the GUI mode of the program, run the jar file without any command-line arguments.
- Upon running the jar file, a GUI window will appear with a blank white panel on the left and a cluster of buttons and text boxes on the right.
- In order to get started with the image manipulations, you first need to load an image.
- Locate the "Load" button on the ride side of the GUI window. Upon clicking the button, a dialogue box will open allowing you to choose a file.
- The accepted formats are: PNG, JPG, BMP, and PPM.
- Once an image is chosen, the left panel will load the image that you have chosen, so that you can view and scroll through the image.
- You will also see a line graph histogram of the red, green, blue, and intensity components in the upper right corner.
- The red, green, and blue components are visualized with their own colored lines, and the intensity component is the black line.
- Below the "Load" and "Save" buttons is a drop-down menu. Selecting a value in the drop-down will set the image to a greyscale image of the chosen component for each pixel.
- Below this are the buttons Greyscale, Sepia, Horizontal flip, Vertical flip, Blur, and Sharpen.
    - Greyscale: Changes the image to a greyscale rendering.
    - Sepia: Changes the image to a sepia tone rendering.
    - Horizontal flip: Flips the image over the y-axis.
    - Vertical flip: Flips the image over the x-axis.
    - Blur: Applies a Gaussian blur to the image.
    - Sharpen: Applies a filter that sharpens the image.
- At the bottom are two buttons and two corresponding text fields.
- Brighten will brighten the pixels of the image by the amount set in its corresponding box.
- Darken will do the same for its own corresponding box.
- Both fields can accept negative values, which will do the reverse. (i.e. -50 in the Brighten field will darken the image by 50)
- You will see that the histogram and display image will be updated every time you perform one of the operations.
- Finally, if you want to save the image to your computer, you can do so by clicking on the "Save" button next to the "Load" button.
- This button will bring up a dialogue box where you can name and save your output image.
- The program will exit when you quit out of the window.
